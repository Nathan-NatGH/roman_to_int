# roman_to_int
Validate and convert Roman numerals to Arabic.
It took me what felt like forever to get it done, but it's the first of (hopefully many) coding challenges.
I didn't need to validate, but decided what the heck. BRUTAL. Until I discovered a validation library to help.
But the conversion part and style are all mine. My little Hello World.
